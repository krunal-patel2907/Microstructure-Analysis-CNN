# Microstructure-Analysis-CNN

The Expermients are still being carried out, partial dataset is uploaded and annotated in coco format using RoboFlow.
To implement Mask RCNN you can use the following repository: https://github.com/ahmedfgad/Mask-RCNN-TF2

The code for training and predicting on custom dataset is added in the micro folder.
